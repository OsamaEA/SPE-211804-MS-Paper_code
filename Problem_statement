# It is why we do AI, not how we do it.
This paper was developed to contribute to the previous research in the same area and overcome the existing obstacles.

## Constraints of previous work:
1) Pretermitting the mechanism of bottom-water coning.
2) Ineffectiveness with noisy production data.
3) Inability to do consistent segmentation.

## How did we tackle the challenges?
1) Constructed large public dataset (10,000 wells).
2) Removed anomalies using ML and statistics.
3) Employed Computer vision to segment multiple Chan patterns.
4) In addition, we deployed the model on production.
